Style and Themes

The Kurogo Framework supports both simple and deep visual customization to reflect your organization's visual brand identity. Basic visual properties (such as colors, content and header backgrounds, fonts, and more) are very easy to customize across all device classes with changes to a theme configuration file and a handful of CSS files. Logos, module icons, header and body backgrounds, and other images can be easily replaced to complete your visual branding. Kurogo also gives you the flexibility to deliver advanced CSS and high-resolution images to devices and browsers that can support them, or use a simpler set of theme assets to simplify theme creation and maintenance.

Beyond straightforward visual branding, Kurogo theming can also extend deeper into application-level styling, templates, and images. Just about anything your users can see or interact with can be customized, depending on your institution's needs and your development team's technical abilities. This document covers the basics of visual theming; functional customization through module extensions and template overrides is covered in :doc:`moduleextend`.

Visual theming requires a working understanding of CSS, and skill with an image editor such as Photoshop or GIMP.



****************
Theming Overview
****************

The Kurogo Framework has a theming layer which allows sites to make most stylistic changes to the web application without modifying the core libraries.  The advantage of using the theming layer is that site changes are isolated from the framework sources and can be more easily moved to a new version of the framework.

The core visual interface of Kurogo lives in *app/*.  It is made up of HTML templates, CSS and Javascript files, and a core set of application images.  All HTML, CSS and Javascript in the core interface can be overridden by a theme. While it's possible to directly edit the files in *app/*, doing so will increase the probability that future upgrades to Kurogo will break your site. As with everything else you build with Kurogo, it is highly recommended that you **not** directly edit any contents of this directory. If there are CSS rules or image files you wish to replace in your theme, it is recommended that you create new versions of those rules and images in your theme directory.

Each theme is contained within a directory inside the *SITE_DIR/themes* folder. By convention the default theme is named *default*. Each site can have multiple themes, but only one theme can be active at any time. You can easily switch between active themes from the *Site Configuration > Theme* screen in the Kurogo administration console.

Themes have the same directory structure as the core visual interface directory (app/). This allows paths in the CSS and HTML to be the same for the core interface and the theme interface.



**********************************
Tutorial: Implement a Simple Theme
**********************************

Because of Kurogo's breadth and depth, implementing a simple theme is a multi-step process. However, each step can be broken down into fairly discrete tasks, and with each version of Kurogo we have made efforts to reduce the number of files and image assets that need to be revised or replaced to create a workable theme. Of course, theming can be as deep and extensive as you desire. This is part of Kurogo's underlying philosophy of flexibility and scalability -- making it easy to get up and running while supporting potentially limitless customization and extension to meet your organization's specific mobile needs now and in the future.

-----------------------------------
1. Create a working theme directory
-----------------------------------
It's recommended that you build a new theme by duplicating the default theme, editing its theme CSS, and replacing key image files. This allows you to quickly switch back to the default theme to check the effect of changes you're making in your new theme, or to revert to a working theme if you run into trouble.

The first decision to make is whether you want to make the extra effort to create high-resolution assets as part of :ref:`hdpi`. This extra effort (consisting of several extra versions of up to dozens of image files) can yield noticeably sharper-looking images on devices with high-resolution screens. Don't worry if you're not sure or change your mind; you can always start with the default (simpler) theme structure and refine later with as much or as little high-density optimization as you like.

In *SITE_DIR/themes*, duplicate either the *default* (simpler) or *hi-def* (optimized for high-density displays) directory and give the new directory a descriptive name.

In your site's Kurogo administration console, go to the *Site Configuration > Theme* page and select your new theme, and click the "Save" button.

In a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox 4+, Safari 4+), open a few test views of your site for different device classes:

* *http://[SITE_PATH]/device/compliant/home/*
* *http://[SITE_PATH]/device/compliant-bbplus/home/*
* *http://[SITE_PATH]/device/touch/home/*
* *http://[SITE_PATH]/device/basic/home/*
* *http://[SITE_PATH]/device/tablet/home/*

As you make the changes detailed below, come back to your browser and refresh the relevant test views to make sure that the changes have the intended effect.


--------------------------------
2. Modify the basic theme values
--------------------------------

Kurogo 1.4 introduces support for setting theme values in a single configuration file, for theme attributes such as colors and font styles that get applied across many theme CSS files. This theme configuration file dramatically simplifies the definition of most if not all of the core theming that was previously done in CSS.

In your theme directory (which we'll refer to from now on as *THEME_DIR*), open *config.ini*. This is the theme configuration file. 

At runtime, Kurogo parses all of the CSS which has been concatenated for the current page and device class and looks for a specific text pattern that indicates the use of theme constants. You can see this in your *THEME_DIR/common/common.css* file; look for any value defined in the format *@@@[constant_name]@@@*. Kurogo then replaces this pattern with the value of that named constant as defined in the theme configuration file. For instance, every instance of *@@@primary_text_color@@@* will be replaced by the actual value of the constant *primary_text_color* as defined in your theme configuration file; in the case of the standard Kurogo reference theme ("Universitas" in blue), this value is #036, or a dark blue. So, for example, line 15 of common.css would be delivered to the user's browser as *color: #036*.

In *THEME_DIR/config.ini*, the global theme style constants are in lines 14-39. These constants are:

* *primary_font_family*: Font family definition for the entire site. This can be defined as a single value (e.g., "Arial" or "sans-serif"), but given the non-overlapping range of default fonts available on different mobile platforms, an array of families is recommended, with a fallback of "sans-serif" or "serif".
* *base_font_size*: Base font size. Almost all of the other font sizes throughout your web app will be calculated as percentages of this base font size, which can be specified in points or pixels.
* *primary_text_color*: Primary text color for most text and navigation elements throughout the site
* *secondary_text_color*: Text color for secondary text such as smallprint, fineprint, legends, labels, nonselected tabs, and text in secondary nav lists
* *tertiary_text_color*: Text color for the small-print detail text that sometimes shows up in secondary nav list items
* *nonfocal_text_color*: Color of text items (including text links) that appear on the body background, e.g., within nonfocal elements
* *strong_text_color*: Text color for certain emphasized elements, such as active tabs
* *heading_font_family*: Font family for <h1> and <h2> elements, including content item titles
* *primary_heading_color*: Text color for <h1> and <h2> elements, including content item titles
* *secondary_heading_color*: Color for <h3> and <h4> elements, including section headings within grouped tables and subheadings within content areas
* *nonfocal_heading_color*: Color for all <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, and <h4> elements that appear on the body background, e.g., within nonfocal elements
* *focal_link_color*: Color of text links within focal content areas
* *nonfocal_link_color*: Color of text links that appear on the body background, e.g., within nonfocal elements
* *body_background_color*: Overall body background color. Often largely or even entirely hidden or overridden by focal content areas.
* *body_background_image*: Overall body background image. Optional; use "none" if no image is required, or CSS format e.g., "url(/common/images/bodyback.jpg)"
* *focal_background_color*: Background color for focal content areas and navigation and results lists
* *subfocal_background_color*: Tinted background color for subfocal content areas and nested navigation lists. Usually a tint between body_background_color and focal_background_color
* *focal_border_color*: Color of borders around focal content areas and navigation and results lists, and hairlines between list items
* *search_border_color*: Color of borders around search fields and behind text search buttons
* *navbar_background_color*: Background color behind navbar (usually not seen if there's a navbar background image)
* *navbar_text_color*: Color of navigation-bar text (page title and breadcrumb text) in Compliant and Tablet device classes

In addition to modifying these theme configuration values, you can always modify or override individual rules in specific theme CSS files. However, simply changing these theme configuration values will take care of most, if not all, of the theming that previously required editing actual CSS.


------------------------------------------
3. Add your logo or other branding artwork
------------------------------------------
Your organization's logo (or other identifying/branding image to be used in your mobile web app) will typically appear in several places:

Homepage
~~~~~~~~
You'll need to create a version of the logo to appear on the homepage: [#f1]_ [#f2]_

* Basic and Touch device classes: *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/logo-home.gif* must be a GIF image [#f3]_. This image will be centered horizontally within the screen. The default size is 208x35px, cropped tight to the actual artwork.
* Compliant device class: *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/logo-home.png* must be a PNG image [#f3]_. The default size is 280x60px, cropped tight the actual artwork. The Compliant home logo/banner image is one that benefits noticeably from :ref:`hdpi`. 
	

Header logos
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The top left corner of every screen for every device class includes a logo/branding image. This image appears to the left of the page title on the Basic device class, and as the leftmost part of the header/navigation bar on all other device classes.

* Basic device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/basic/logo.gif* must be a GIF image [#f3]_. The default size is 35x35px.
* Compliant device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/homelink.png* must be a PNG image [#f3]_. The default size is 57x45px. It should be designed in such a way that it appears seamlessly on top of the header/navigation bar background (*navback.png*, in, in the same directory). The Compliant header logo is one item that benefits from :ref:`hdpi`.
* Touch device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/touch/homelink.gif* must be a GIF image [#f3]_. The default size is 40x30px. It should be designed in such a way that it appears seamlessly on top of the header/navigation bar background (*navback.jpg*, in, in the same directory). Typically it should incorporate some visual indication of a drilldown (e.g., right-facing arrow) to the right of the actual logo.
* Tablet device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/homelink.png* must be a PNG image [#f3]_. The default size is 66x52px. This is designed in such a way that it appears seamlessly on top of the header/navigation bar background (*navback.png*, in the same directory).
	
	
Favicon and bookmark icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* *THEME_DIR/common/images/favicon.ico* must be a 16x16px ICO file, which is variously used by different browsers as the favicon, bookmarks and history icon, and in the screen title bar.
* *THEME_DIR/common/images/icon.png* must be a 57x57 (or pixel-doubled 114x114px; see :ref:`hdpi` [#f3]_) PNG, used as the homescreen shortcut icon for iOS devices and some Android devices.  
	
	
----------------------------------------
4. Customize or replace the module icons
----------------------------------------
Each module is visually represented by an icon on all device classes other than Basic. Kurogo's default theme includes a full set of professionally-created module icons, including many for modules not actually included in Kurogo. You are free to use and modify these icons, or replace some or all of them with ones that you create or license. If you're creating or licensing your own module icons, it's highly recommended that you start with vector images (e.g., Illustrator or EPS), which can be scaled to any size at full quality. If you can't create or purchase vector icon images, at least make every effort to start with bitmap (e.g., Photoshop) images at a large size such as 200x200px before scaling down to the actual sizes and formats you'll need for your web app. 

The module icons need to be saved in the following sizes and formats:


Homepage module icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These appear on the homepage, as well as the Customize Homescreen module and the desktop-oriented Info module. 

* Compliant device class: The module icons in *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/complaint/[MODULE_ID].png* must be PNG images [#f3]_. They should be the same size as the springboard images for modern BlackBerry devices (as set in *THEME_DIR/common/css/compliant-bbplus.css*, lines 26-27, and *THEME_DIR/common/css/compliant-blackberry.css*, lines 17-18). By default this is 64x64px, which is slightly larger than the default size for other Compliant devices. The file names must be exactly in the format *[MODULE_ID].png* (e.g., calendar.png, map.png, news.png, etc.)[#f4]_. For Compliant devices, the homepage icons may notably benefit from :ref:`hdpi`.
* Touch device class: The module icons in *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/touch/[MODULE_ID].gif* must be GIF images [#f3]_. The default size is 44x44px. The file names must be exactly *[MODULE_ID].gif* (e.g., calendar.gif, map.gif, news.gif, etc.) [#f4]_




Breadcrumb module icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These appear in the header/navigation bar at the top of every module page in all device classes other than Basic. On each module's main screen, the icon is used to identify the module but is not tappable; in all subsequent drilldown screens, the icon is incorporated into a tappable/clickable breadcrumb by which the user can navigate back to the module home screen.

* Compliant device class: The icons in *THEME_DIR/common/images/complaint/title_[MODULE_ID].png* must be PNG images [#f3]_, generally transparent, colored and styled to look good on the background color/image for the navigation bar (this background is specified in the *#navbar* rule in *THEME_DIR/common/css/compliant.css*). The default size is 28x28px. For Compliant devices, the breadcrumb module icons may notably benefit from :ref:`hdpi`.
* Touch device class: The icons in *THEME_DIR/common/images/touch/title_[MODULE_ID].gif* must be GIF images [#f3]_, generally transparent, colored and styled to look good on the background color/image for the navigation bar (this background is specified in the *#navbar* rule in *THEME_DIR/common/css/touch.css*).. The default size is 28x28px.
* Tablet device class: The icons in *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/title_[MODULE_ID].png* must be PNG images [#f3]_, generally transparent, colored and styled to look good on the background color/image for the navigation bar (this background is specified in the *#navbar* rule in *THEME_DIR/common/css/tablet.css*).. The default size is 28x28px.



Tablet tab-bar module icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Tablet device class uses a site-wide tab bar at the bottom of the screen to provide quick navigation between modules. Though not technically part of the Tablet homepage, these images are in the *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/tablet/* directory, to keep them grouped with the other module icons of similar size and format. The Tablet's tab bar uses two variations of the module icons. Both variations must be transparent PNGs [#f3]_ at 45x45px. Larger sizes will work fine, but with no visible benefit..

* Normal/unselected: Should be colored and styled for good contrast and legibility against the background for the Tablet tab bar. This background is specified in the *#footernav* rule in *THEME_DIR/common/css/tablet.css*. The file names must be exactly *[MODULE_ID].png* (e.g., calendar.png, map.png, news.png, etc.) [#f4]_

* Selected: Should be colored and styled for good contrast and legibility against the background for the selected state of the Tablet tab bar. This background is specified in the *#footernav .selected a* rule in *THEME_DIR/common/css/tablet.css*. The file names must be exactly *[MODULE_ID]-selected.png* (e.g., calendar.png, map.png, news.png, etc.) [#f4]_

	
-------------------------------------------	
5. Customize or replace supporting graphics
-------------------------------------------
The following secondary and support graphics should be color-adjusted or replaced to match your overall theme design:

Help buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Buttons in the top right of the screen for Compliant and Tablet device classes: 

* Compliant device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/help.png* must be a PNG image, typically 24-bit with transparency, for use on Compliant-class devices. The default size is 46x45px. It should be designed in such a way that it appears seamlessly on top of the header/navigation bar background (navback.png, in the same directory).
* Tablet device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/help.png* must be a PNG image, typically 24-bit with transparency, for use on Compliant-class devices. The default size is 52x52px. It should be designed in such a way that it appears seamlessly on top of the header/navigation bar background (navback.png, in the same directory).


Header bar backgrounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tiling background image for the header bar (navigation and breadrcrumbs) at the top of every screen in most device classes:

* Compliant device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/navback.png* must be a PNG image, typically 24-bit with transparency, for use on Compliant-class devices. The default size is any width by 48px tall, of which the bottom 3px is typically a drop shadow fading to transparent.
* Touch device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/touch/navback.jpg* must be a JPG image, for use on Touch-class devices. The default size is any width by 48px tall, of which the bottom 3px is typically a drop shadow fading to the body background color.
* Tablet device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/navback.png* must be a PNG image, typically 24-bit with transparency, for use on Tablet-class devices. The default size is any width by 50px tall.



Breadcrumb separator images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Separator image between elements of the breadcrumb (drill-up) links in the header bar for Compliant and Tablet device classes:

* Compliant device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/drillup-r.png* must be a PNG image, typically 24-bit with or without transparency, for use on Compliant-class devices. The default size is 18x45px, and it should be designed to sit seamlessly on top of the header bar background (*THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/navback.png*).
* Compliant device class: *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/drillup-r.png* must be a PNG image, typically 24-bit with transparency, for use on Compliant-class devices. The default size is 18x50px, and it should be designed to sit seamlessly on top of the header bar background (*THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/navback.png*).



Other graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Color-adjust or replace any or all of the following with images of the same size and format:

* Bullet images: *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/bullet.png* and *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/bullet.png* (identical), and *THEME_DIR/common/images/touch/bullet.gif*
* Search buttons: *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/search_button.png* and *THEME_DIR/common/images/tablet/bullet.png* (identical)

************************************
Optimizing for High-Density Displays
************************************
All modern smartphones have displays with a pixel density (number of pixels per physical inch) higher than a typical desktop or laptop computer. For example, the first three generations of iPhones and iPod Touches, and the first generation of Android and webOS devices, all had displays with 150-170 pixels per inch (ppi).

A growing number of high-end devices have significantly higher-density displays, to further improve clarity and legibility. iOS devices with Retina Displays (iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4) have twice the pixel density of older iOS devices. Android devices with HDPI displays (e.g., with the common 480x800px or 480x854px screens), Windows Phone 7 devices, and some recent webOS devices have 1.5 times (or more) the pixel density of earlier/lower-end smartphones. Because these devices have more physical screen pixels in the same space, text and images can look sharper and more legible, especially for small text and detailed graphics. 

On such devices, web pages that provide a higher-resolution image while retaining the display size (through HTML attributes or CSS) can yield images that are visibly sharper and more legible on-screen. For instance, substituting a pixel-doubled homescreen logo (*THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/logo-home.png*) at 560x120px (twice the default 280x60px size) while retaining the *width=280, height=60* attributes in HTML will make that image have maximum possible visual quality on high-density displays. However, this comes at the cost of larger file size. You need to evaluate whether the increased visual quality and legibility are worth the tradeoff. In many cases, 1.5x assets (e.g., 420x90px version of *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/logo-home.png*) will offer a good tradeoff between increased visual quality and file-size. You may want to experiment with different multipliers, viewing the results on different devices, to find the best tradeoff on an image-by-image basis. 

Generally, logos, highly detailed images, and images incorporating text will benefit most from using high-density versions. Note that BlackBerry devices running any OS prior to 6.0 do not scale images well, so it's best to use images sized exactly for them. Currently there are no tablet devices that take advantage of high-density images.

Kurogo ships with two reference themes: default (simple, standard-resolution) and "hi-def" (with optimizations for high-density displays). By switching between these themes in your site admin console and viewing it on a high-density device (e.g., iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, high-end Android device, Pre3, etc.), you can see for yourself the difference that such optimizations make, and decide for yourself the degree to which you want to make such optimizations for your own site.

The following items will benefit the most from using higher-resolution images. The general technique is the add the higher-than-default-resolution images to the *[IMAGE_DIR]/compliant/* directory, and default-resolution images to the *[IMAGE_DIR/compliant-blackberry]* and *[IMAGE_DIR/compliant-bbplus]* directories.

----------------
Home-screen logo
----------------
Assuming you've created your standard-resolution *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/logo-home.png* image, make duplicates of it into *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/compliant-bbplus* and *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/compliant-blackberry* directories. Then replace *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/logo-home.png* with a higher-resolution version.

------------------
Header logo images
------------------
Assuming you've created your standard-resolution *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/homelink.png* image, make duplicates of it into *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant-bbplus* and *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant-blackberry* directories. Then replace *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/homelink.png* with a higher-resolution version, making sure that this higher-resolution version mates well with the navbar background image (*THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/navback.png*).

---------------------
Homepage module icons
---------------------
Assuming you've created your standard-resolution module icons at *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/compliant/[MODULE_ID].png*, make duplicates of all of them into *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/compliant-bbplus* and *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/compliant-blackberry* directories. Then replace the module icons in *THEME_DIR/modules/home/images/compliant* with higher-resolution versions, being sure to name them exactly *[MODULE_ID].png* [#f4]_. **Caution:** This can quickly make the total filesize of your homepage quite large, especially if you have a lot of modules. Try 1.5x versions of these images first, rather than 2x (Retina Display) versions.

-----------------------
Breadcrumb module icons
-----------------------
Assuming you've created your standard-resolution breadcrumb module icons at *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/title_[MODULE_ID].png*, make duplicates of all of them into *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant/compliant-bbplus* and *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant-blackberry* directories. Then replace the module icons in *THEME_DIR/common/images/compliant* with higher-resolution versions, being sure to name them exactly *title_[MODULE_ID].png* [#f4]_.

Technical Notes about Theming
*****************************

------------------
CSS and Javascript
------------------

All CSS and Javascript files are loaded automatically using Minify.  Rather than having to specify 
each CSS and Javascript file per page, Minify locates the files based on their names.  The naming 
scheme is similar to that of the templates, except there is a special file name "common" which 
indicates the file should be included for all devices:

CSS Search Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSS search paths from least specific to most specific.  All matching CSS files are concatenated 
together from least specific to most specific.  This allows you to override styles for specific 
pages or devices.

Check common core files in */app/common/css/* for:

* common.css
* [PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css
* [PAGE]-common.css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css
  
Check module core files in */app/modules/[current module]/css/* for:

* common.css
* [PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css
* [PAGE]-common.css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css

Check common theme files in *SITE_DIR/themes/[ACTIVE_THEME]/common/css*/ for:

* common.css
* [PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css
* [PAGE]-common.css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css

Check module theme files in *SITE_DIR/themes/[ACTIVE_THEME]/modules/[current module]/css/* for:

* common.css
* [PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css
* [PAGE]-common.css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].css
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].css


Javascript Search Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because Javascript does not allow overriding of functions, only the most device specific file in 
each directory is included, and theme files completely override core files.  When overriding be aware 
that you may need to duplicate code or move it into a common file to get it included on multiple 
pagetypes or platforms.

Check common theme files in *SITE_DIR/themes/[ACTIVE_THEME]/common/javascript/* for:

* common.js
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGETYPE].js
* [PAGE]-common.js
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].js

If there are no common theme files, check common core files in /app/common/javascript/* for:

* common.js
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGETYPE].js
* [PAGE]-common.js
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].js

Check module theme files in *SITE_DIR/themes/[ACTIVE_THEME]/modules/[current module]/javascript/* for:

* common.js
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGETYPE].js
* [PAGE]-common.js
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].js

If there are no module theme files, check module core files in */app/modules/[current module]/javascript/* for:

* common.js
* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGETYPE].js
* [PAGE]-common.js
* [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM].js or if not check [PAGE]-[PAGETYPE].js
    

Because Minify combines all files into a single file, it can be hard to tell where an given line of 
CSS or Javascript actually comes from.  When Minify debugging is turned on (MINIFY_DEBUG == 1), 
Minify adds comments to help with locating the actual file associated with a given line.

Note that the framework caches which files exist so it doesn't have to check all the possible files 
on every page load.  If you add a new file you may need to empty the minify cache to pick up the new file.

------
Images
------

Because images can live in either the core templates folder or the theme folder, image paths have 
the theme and platform directories added automatically.  Images are either common to all modules or 
belong to a specific module.  In order to allow flexible image naming, the device the image is for 
is specified by folder name rather than file name.

Images are searched across paths and the first image file present is returned.  

Common Image Search Paths: (ie: /common/images/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT])
    
Check theme images in *SITE_DIR/themes/[ACTIVE_THEME]/common/images/* for:

* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [PAGETYPE]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]

Check core images in */app/common/images/* for:

* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [PAGETYPE]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]

Module Image Search Paths: (ie: /modules/[MODULE_ID]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT])

Check theme images in *SITE_DIR/themes/[ACTIVE_THEME]/modules/links/images/* for:

* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [PAGETYPE]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]

Check core images in */app/modules/[MODULE_ID]/images/[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM]/* for:

* [PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [PAGETYPE]/[IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]
* [IMAGE_NAME].[EXT]

The rationale for searching for images rather than just specifying the full path is so that themes 
don't have to override a template just to replace an image being referenced inside it with an IMG tag.  
By dropping their own version of the image in the theme folder, the theme image will automatically be 
selected.  The device selection aspect of the image search algorithm is mostly just for convenience 
and to make the templates and CSS files more terse.

Note that image paths in CSS and templates should always be specified by an absolute path 
(ie: start with a /) but not contain the protocol, server, port, etc.  Any url base or device path 
will be prepended automatically by the framework.

.. [#f1] **Custom homepage logo/banner image sizes:** *THEME_DIR/config.ini* stores the height and width of the homescreen logo/banner image for different device classes. The values defined in this config file are written into the actual HTML as attributes on the <img> tag. The reason these image dimensions are handled this way, rather than in CSS, is that many browsers will not apply a CSS height and width until the image is loaded, but will always reserve the space defined in the <img> object's *height* and *width* attributes. The CSS-driven approach will cause the items on the home screen to jump vertically as soon as the logo image finishes loading, causing a usability problem, especially on touchscreen devices. 
.. [#f2] **Homepage with full-bleed banner image:** If you create a home-page design a full-bleed focal image at the top of the page (e.g., a large photograph with your logo superimposed on it), you can set the image dimensions in *THEME_DIR/config.ini* to *banner-width = 100%* and *banner-height = auto*. You should create the artwork at a minimum width of 320px, with a recommended maximum height of 240px. Note that this approach is only recommended for the Compliant device class, as the GIF image(s) used for the Basic and Touch device classes will render very poorly when scaled.
.. [#f3] **Transparent GIFs and PNGs:** Assets for the Basic and Touch device classes are often GIFs. These should typically be transparent with a transparency matte color matching your homepage background color (except for images that are meant exclusively to sit on focal content areas, in which case the transparency matte color should be white). Assets for the Compliant and Tablet device classes are often PNGs. When tranparent PNGs are used, 24-bit with transparency will work best; 8-bit with transparency can be used to minimize file-size, but the background matte color will need to be set similarly to that of the transparent GIFs.
.. [#f4] **Module IDs:** All of the variations of the module icons need to have filenames based on the relevant module ID. Generally, you'll be safe just replacing existing files with new ones with the same name. If you want to be sure of the module ID, you can go to you r
