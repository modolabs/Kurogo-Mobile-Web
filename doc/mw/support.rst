Getting Support
###############

As an open source project, Kurogo does not include formal support. There are a number of outlets to
receive informal support, as well as options for paid support.

===================
Kurogo Google Group
===================

In order to facilite community support, a Google Group named Kurogo-dev has been created. This group
includes a mailing list where users can share questions and answers. This list is monitored by members
of Modo Labs (maintainers of the Kurogo code), however responses are not guaranteed.
