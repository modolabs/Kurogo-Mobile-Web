Kurogo Developer's Guide
************************

The Kurogo Framework is a PHP based web application that can help organizations efficiently deliver
services and information to a wide array of mobile devices. Based on the MIT Framework, this
open source project provides a modular way to present mobile versions of various data sources in an
extendable, customizable fashion.

At a high level, the Kurogo Framework includes:

* A mechanism for detecting device characteristics and displaying content best suited for that device
* A object oriented system for retrieving, parsing and displaying data from a variety of external sources
* A robust templating system that utilizes themeable reusable parts to easily construct consistent user interfaces
* A series of prebuilt, customizable modules for gathering directory, news and event information
* A system of authentication and authorization for controlling access to content and administrative functions

This guide serves as a tour of the project source code and its features.
