Configuration
#############

The Kurogo framework requires very little setup to operate initially. For a production system, 
however, you are going to want to be familiar with many of the site and module options that can 
affect file locations, debugging information and module behavior. 

All of the site's configuration is controlled using .ini files. You can either edit these files 
manually or use the :ref:`admin-module` to edit most of these values. 

=======================
Structure of .ini Files
=======================

Most developers and administrators should find the structure of .ini files familiar. For a complete
explanation on ini files, see the documentation for the `parse_ini_file() <http://php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php>`_
function in the PHP manual.

----------
Properties
----------

The basic element contained in an INI file is the property. Every property has a name and a value, 
delimited by an equals sign (=). The name appears to the left of the equals sign. Strings should be
enclosed in double quote marks. Constants can be included outside quote marks. A unique feature of the
framework allows you to reference other values in included ini files by using braces {} around the
key name to include. 

.. code-block:: ini

    key1="value"
    key2=CONSTANT
    key3=ANOTHER_CONSTANT "value"
    key4="Using value {key3}"
    
--------    
Sections
--------

Properties may be grouped into arbitrarily named sections. The section name appears on a line by itself, 
in square brackets ([ and ]). All properties after the section declaration are associated with that 
section. There is no explicit "end of section" delimiter; sections end at the next section declaration, 
or the end of the file. Sections may not be nested.

.. code-block:: ini

    [section]
    
--------    
Comments
--------

Semicolons (;) indicate the start of a comment. Comments continue to the end of the line. 
Everything between the semicolon and the End of Line is ignored.

.. code-block:: ini
    
    ; comment text
    
===================
Configuration files
===================

When running a module, the following config files are loaded automatically:

* *config/kurogo.ini* The framework config file. It's primary role is to indicate the active site and
  configuration mode
* *SITE_DIR/config/site.ini* - The site configuration file. It contains properties shared by all
  modules and sets up the basic environment
* *SITE_DIR/config/strings.ini* - Strings table. Includes various strings used throughout the site
* *SITE_DIR/config/MODULEID/module.ini* - Basic configuration file for the current module. Specifies properties
  regarding the module including disabled status, protected, secure and authorization. Also includes
  any unique module configurable parameters
* *SITE_DIR/config/MODULEID/pages.ini* - Title/navigation configuration for the current module. 

Other modules may also load files from the *SITE_DIR/config/MODULEID* folder for external data configuration,
and specific configuration for module output and formatting. Refer to the documentation for a particular
module to know the composition of those files.

-----------
Local Files
-----------

The framework supports overriding configuration files for local server customization. Unless
the configuration value *CONFIG_IGNORE_LOCAL* (defined in *config/kurogo.ini*) is set to 1, the
framework will also load files with a -local in the file name for each configuration file loaded.
I.e. *SITE_DIR/config/site.ini* can be overridden with *SITE_DIR/config/site-local.ini*. 
*SITE_DIR/config/home/module.ini* can be overridden with *SITE_DIR/config/home/module-local.ini*.
It is **not** necessary to duplicate the entire file. Only the values that are different need to be 
in the -local file. It could also include additional values that are not present in the base config.

These files are ignored by the git version control system and are an excellent place to put sensitive
file paths or credentials that should not be part of a public source code repository. It can
also aid in deployment since your development machine may use different settings than a production
server.

If *CONFIG_IGNORE_LOCAL* is set to 1, then -local files will be ignored. This is useful if you do
not use them and may slightly improve performance.

------------------
Configuration Mode
------------------

In addition to -local files. There is also an option to include configuration override files by
specifying a mode string. This string is like -local but can be set to any value. This will allow
you to create multiple versions of configuration files, with slightly different versions of certain
values and instantly switch between them. This option is set in the *CONFIG_MODE* value of *config/kurogo.ini*
These files are not ignored by git.

One use of this would be to create development and production versions of some of your configuration files. 
You can have *SITE_DIR/site-development.ini* and *SITE_DIR/site-production.ini* with differing
values for debugging. Then you can set *CONFIG_MODE* to **development** or **production**. If *CONFIG_MODE*
is empty (the default), than no files will be searched. Another example would be to include authorization values
for certain modules in a production environment. 

Keep in mind that this setting is independent of -local files. -local files will override any option
presuming *CONFIG_IGNORE_LOCAL* is not enabled. 

Kurogo has included a series of example -production.ini files to indicate recommended values for production 
servers

-------------------------------
Retrieving Configuration Values
-------------------------------

There are a variety of methods that are used to retrieve values from the configuration files. Please
see :ref:`Module Configuration <modules_configuration>` for more information on how to retrieve these values in your module.

==================
Site Configuration
==================

The *SITE_DIR/config/site.ini* file configures the basic site configuration. It is broken
up into several sections

----------------------------
Error handling and debugging
----------------------------

The properties in this section are used during development. Most of them are boolean values (0 is off, 1 is on)

* *DEFAULT_LOGGING_LEVEL* - See :doc:`logging` for more information.
* *LOGGING_LEVEL[area]* - See :doc:`logging` for more information.
* *DISPLAY_ERRORS* - Display PHP errors. This can make discovering bugs more easy. You should turn this
  off on a production site.
* *DEVICE_DEBUG* - When the framework is running in device debugging mode, you can prepend any framework 
  url with *device/[PAGETYPE]-[PLATFORM]/* or *device/[PAGETYPE]/* to see that version of the page in 
  your browser.  So for example "/device/basic/about/" will show the basic version of the About 
  module's index page.
* *MODULE_DEBUG* - Enables debugging information provided by each module. The type of information will
  vary by module. An example of this is showing the LDAP server used by the People module
* *MINIFY_DEBUG* - When Minify debugging is turned on, Minify adds comments to help with locating the 
  actual file associated with a given line.
* *DATA_DEBUG* - Data debugging enables logging and certain output to debug data connections. 
  When turned on, it will log url requests in the error log.
* *DEVICE_DETECTION_DEBUG* - Show the device detection info in the footer
* *PRODUCTION_ERROR_HANDLER_ENABLED* - The production error handler will email exceptions to the DEVELOPER_EMAIL
  address. You should treat exceptions as extraordinary situations that should normally not occur in production
  environments.
* *DEVELOPER_EMAIL* - an email address to send exception notices. At this time, it uses the php *mail()* 
  function so it may not be compatible with all environments.

You should turn the _DEBUG options to off in a production environment and enable the Production Error Handler
with an appropriate developer email address. 

-------------
Site settings
-------------

* *SITE_DISABLED* - When set to 1 this site is disabled. Useful for :doc:`multisite`
* *SECURE_REQUIRED* - When set to 1 then the site will require a secure (https) connection
* *SECURE_HOST* - Alternate hostname to use for secure (https) connections. If not included it will use the same host name.
* *SECURE_PORT* - Alternate port to use for secure connections. Typically you should leave it at the default of 443
* *LOCALE* - Locales are used for date/time formatting. If you wish to use a locale other than the server default, then you should set this. 
  Note that valid values are dependent on the operating system of the server.
* *LANGUAGES[]* - A list of language priorities. See :doc:`localization` for more info.
* *LOCAL_TIMEZONE* - Set this to your environment's time zone. See http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
  for a list of valid time zones
* *LOCAL_AREA_CODE* - Set this to your environment's primary area code
* *AUTODETECT_PHONE_NUMBERS* - Turn this off to prevent the auto detection of telephone numbers in 
  content. This is primarily only supported in iOS devices at this time.
  
  
-------
Modules
-------

* *DYNAMIC_MODULE_NAV_DATA*  - This value determines whether
  modules can present dynamic data on the navigation home screen. This could include dynamic titles, 
  images or other information. If you are not providing dynamic data, then you should turn off this
  option. It is off by default. See :ref:`dynamic_nav_data` for more information
* *CREATE_DEFAULT_CONFIG* - This value determines whether config folders will be automatically
  created if they don't exist. This can be convienient for development when you want to populate
  a config folder with the default values, but should be turned off for production to ensure
  modules that you don't use don't create configuration folders.
  
-----
Cache
-----

* *MINIFY_CACHE_TIMEOUT* - The timeout for saving the minify cache. This determines how often
  to look for new templates or css/js files. It should be set high for production sites.

.. _analytics:

---------
Analytics
---------

* *GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID* - set this to your google analytics id and the framework will utilize the google 
  analytics server
* *GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_DOMAIN* - If you use subdomains in your google analytics reporting, set this to the appropriate domain
* *PERCENT_MOBILE_ID* - set this to your percent mobile analytics id and the framework will utilize the percent
  mobile analytics server
* *STATS_ENABLED* - if set to 0 then the internal statistics engine will be disabled
* *KUROGO_STATS_TABLE* (kurogo_stats_v1) - The name of the table to use for internal statistics gathering
* *KUROGO_VISIT_LIFESPAN* (1800) - The timeout (in seconds) for tracking visits

--------------
Temp Directory
--------------
* *TMP_DIR* - This should be set to your a writable temporary directory. If this entry is blank, it
  will use the system default temporary directory.

------
Themes
------
* *ACTIVE_THEME* - This is set to the active theme. It should be a valid folder inside the *SITE_DIR/themes* 
  directory. 
* *TABLET_ENABLED* - If set to 0 then the tablet devices will receive the compliant page type templates.
  
.. _url-rewriting:

----------------------------------
URL Rewriting and the default page
----------------------------------

In the **[urls]** section you can put a series of values that allow you to map a url to another. Typically
this would be if you want to map a module's url to several possible values, perhaps to maintain 
historical bookmarks. The entered url will be redirected to the value you specify. For example:

* **directory = people** would map the url */directory* to */people* (i.e. the people module)

Take care that you do not create infinite redirect loops.

There is a special case for the *DEFAULT* url. This is the module that is loaded when users enter your
site without a module name (i.e. the root of your site). You can configure this to show a different
module depending on the type of device/platform. In the initial setting, users browsing your site
from a computer will be presented with the **info** module and users browsing your site from a mobile
device will be shown the **home** module. 

The default option will look for the most specific value when determining which default page to show.
You can create entries like such (in uppercase)

    * *DEFAULT-PAGETYPE-PLATFORM* - matches the specific pagetype/platform combination. like *DEFAULT-COMPLIANT-COMPUTER*
      or *DEFAULT-TOUCH-BLACKBERRY*.
    * *DEFAULT-PAGETYPE* - matches all the devices from a particular pagetype. Like *DEFAULT-COMPLIANT* or
      *DEFAULT-BASIC*
    * *DEFAULT* will match any device if a more specific entry is not found
    
This allows you to customize the front door experience for your users.

.. _devicedetection_config:

----------------
Device Detection
----------------

See :doc:`devicedetection` for more information on configuration values.

-------
Cookies
-------
* *MODULE_ORDER_COOKIE_LIFESPAN* - How long (in seconds) to remember the module order customization. In production
  sites this should be set to a long time, like 15552000 (180 days)
* *LAYOUT_COOKIE_LIFESPAN* - How long to remember the device detection results for pagetype and platform.
  In production sites this should be set to a long time, like 1209600 (14 days)
* *BOOKMARK_COOKIE_LIFESPAN* - How long to remember the saved bookmarks for a user. In production 
  sites this should be set to a long time, like 15552000 (180 days)

--------
Database
--------

The main database connection can be used by a variety of modules for storing and retrieving values.
See the :doc:`database <database>` section for specific information on configuration values.

--------------
Authentication
--------------
* *AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED* - Set to 1 to enable :doc:`authentication <authentication>`
* *AUTHENTICATION_IDLE_TIMEOUT* - Idle Timeout in seconds before users are logged off Use 0 to disable
* *AUTHENTICATION_USE_SESSION_DB* - If 1 then session data will be saved to the site database
* *AUTHENTICATION_REMAIN_LOGGED_IN_TIME* - Time in seconds where users can choose to remain logged in
  even if closing their browser. If this is set to 0 then user's cannot remain logged in. Typical
  times are 604800 (7 days) or 1209600 (14 days).

---------
Log Files
---------
* *KUROGO_LOG_FILE* - The location of the Kurogo log file. This is where all Kurogo log statements
  will be placed depending on the value of DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL
* *LOG_DATE_FORMAT* - Date format for log files
* *LOG_DATE_PATTERN* - regex pattern of log dates, should match output from LOG_DATE_FORMAT

================================
Module Visibility and protection
================================

Each module contains an configuration file in *SITE_DIR/config/moduleID/module.ini*. This file
contains values common to all modules, as well as module specific values. 

* *id* - The module id to use. By default this will be the same name as the moduleID. You can 
  change this to create a :ref:`copied module <copy-module>` or to use another module's code
  at this url. 
* *title* - The module title. Used in the title bar and other locations
* *disabled* - Whether or not the module is disabled. A disabled module cannot be used by anyone. Use
  this value for temporarily disabling modules.
* *search* - Whether or not the module provides search in the federated search feature.
* *secure* - Whether or not the module requires a secure (https) connection. Configuring secure
  sites is beyond the scope of this document.
  
-----------------------------
Permanently disabling modules
-----------------------------

When *CREATE_DEFAULT_CONFIG* is set to 0, if you remove a module's config folder it will
be permanently disabled and will not be accessible. 

-------------------------------
Optional Common Module Settings
-------------------------------

* *SHOW_LOGIN* - By default the login link only appears on the home module. If you wish for it to
  show up on other modules, you can set this value to 1 on any module you wish to see it. You could
  also set this to 0 on the home module to suppress its showing.
  
===========
Home Screen
===========

See :doc:`modulehome` for information on configuring the look and layout of the home screen.

=======
Strings
=======

There are a number of strings that are used throughout the framework to identify the site name the organization
it is a part of. These include:

* *SITE_NAME* - The name of the site. Used in the footer and other places. 
* *COPYRIGHT_LINK* - Link to copyright notice (optional)
* *COPYRIGHT_NOTICE* - Copyright notice 
* *FEEDBACK_EMAIL* - email address where users can send feedback.

.. _admin-module:

=====================
Administration Module
=====================

In addition to editing these files, you can use the administration module to manage the configuration.
The admin module is located at */admin* and does not have an icon on the home screen.
